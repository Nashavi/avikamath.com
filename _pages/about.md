I'm a data enthusiast based out of Seattle, WA.

I spend my weekdays working as a Jr. Data Scientist in Pactera Technologies, Redmond, WA. At Pactera, I utilize data analytics to provide solutions and recommendations to resolve our client's business problems. I have had a really interesting journey from being a Chartered Accountant (CPA), to an auditor, to now a data scientist with a passion for coding.

When I am not busy crunching data and learning new things, I try to hit the gym, play guitar or spend time outdoors with my family. Besides that, I am a big Chelsea fan and a favorite pastime of mine is playing FIFA on my Xbox One console.

Cheers!
